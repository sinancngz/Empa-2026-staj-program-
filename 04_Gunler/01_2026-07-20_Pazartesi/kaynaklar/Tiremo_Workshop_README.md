## About Tiremo®

**Tiremo®** is an end-to-end AIoT infrastructure platform engineered to accelerate the development and deployment of secure connected devices. It provides a robust ecosystem of hardware, software, and cloud tools with a strong focus on cybersecurity, ensuring edge solutions align with strict regulatory frameworks like **RED** and **CRA**. By bridging Edge AI with scalable cloud integration, Tiremo® enables developers to seamlessly transition from prototyping to production-ready enterprise applications.

## About the Board

This development board is designed by **Empa Electronics** specifically for Edge AI and cloud-IoT applications, and it is delivered with full software support. It is powered by the high-performance **ABOV A34G43ARL2N** microcontroller (ARM® Cortex®-M4F) and features an integrated onboard debugger to streamline your development workflow.

**Hardware Specifications:**

- **Sensors:** Built-in analog MEMS microphone, 3-axis accelerometer, and temperature/humidity sensors for comprehensive environmental monitoring.
- **User Interface:** Ten user LEDs and a single user button facilitate rich visual feedback and physical interaction.
- **Connectivity:** An integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE module connects device data to the cloud or other peripheral hardware. During this workshop, sensor telemetry is routed to the Tiremo® MQTT broker (iot.tiremo.ai) over Wi-Fi or 4G LTE.
- **Power & Debug:** A USB Type-C port (CN6) handles power delivery, firmware flashing, and serial debugging.

**System Architecture:** The board's sensors convert physical stimuli into electronic signals optimized for analysis either locally at the edge or remotely in the cloud. It leverages lightweight protocols like MQTT to transmit data reliably across low-bandwidth connections. Cloud IoT platforms then gather, store, and visualize this telemetry in a centralized system, driving low-latency and energy-efficient applications when the right sensors and connectivity are chosen at the edge.

## Workshop Activities

After setup, follow the activity guide to open the project, select an application, build, and flash the **Tiremo®** board:

### ↳ [1) Data Collection and MQTT Communication with Tiremo®](Project/RunningCode.md)

Three workshop applications are included:

| # | Application | Connectivity |
|---|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Sensor readout to terminal | Debug UART |
| 2 | ESP32 WiFi MQTT | Wi-Fi → `iot.tiremo.ai` |
| 3 | SLM320 4G MQTT | 4G LTE → `iot.tiremo.ai` |

Firmware details: [Project/README.md](Project/README.md)

### ↳ 2) CyberWhiz — Secure IoT on ESP32

ESP-IDF project on **ESP32**: WiFi connection, TLS MQTT, and periodic **Secure Mercek** security telemetry to the cloud. Open `Project/CyberWhiz/` in VS Code with the ESP-IDF extension.
